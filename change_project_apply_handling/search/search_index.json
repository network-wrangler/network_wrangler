System Requirements \u00b6 Network Wrangler should be operating system agonistic and has been tested on Ubuntu and Mac OS. In order to assist in installation, its helpful to have either miniconda , anaconda or Docker CE installed. If you don\u2019t have any of these already, we reommend starting with Miniconda for Python 3.7 as it has the smallest footprint. conda is the environment manager that is contained within both the Anaconda and mini-conda applications. All commands described below should be entered into the Ananconda Prompt command window. Network Wrangler does require Python 3.7+. If you have a different version of Python installed, conda will take care of installing it for you in the installation instructions below. Installation \u00b6 Network Wrangler uses Python 3.6 and above. Requirements are stored in requirements.txt but are automatically installed when using pip . If you are managing multiple python versions, we suggest using virtualenv or conda virtual environments. conda is the environment manager that is contained within both the Anaconda and mini-conda applications. Do not add Anaconda to the system path during installation. This may cause problems with other programs that require python 2.7 to be placed in the system path. Example installing and running tests using conda in the command line: conda config --add channels conda-forge conda create python = 3 .7 rtree geopandas osmnx -n <my_wrangler_environment> conda activate <my_wrangler_environment> pip install network-wrangler pytest Network wrangler can be installed in several ways depending on the user\u2019s needs. Installing from github is the simplest method and is appropriate when the user does not anticipate needing to update network wrangler. An update will require rebuilding the network wrangler environment. Installing from clone is slightly more involved and requires the user to have a git manager on their machine, but permits the user to install network wrangler with the -e , edit, option so that their network wrangler installation can be updated through pulling new commits from the network wrangler repo without a full reinstallation. From GitHub \u00b6 Use the package manager pip to install Network Wrangler from the source on GitHub. conda config --add channels conda-forge conda create python = 3 .7 rtree geopandas osmnx -n <my_wrangler_environment> conda activate <my_wrangler_environment> pip install git+https://github.com/wsp-sag/network_wrangler.git@master#egg = network_wrangler Note: if you wanted to install from a specific tag/version number or branch, replace @master with @<branchname> or @tag From Clone \u00b6 If you are going to be working on Network Wrangler locally, you might want to clone it to your local machine and install it from the clone. The -e will install it in editable mode . This is also useful if you want to continue to update your Network Wrangler as it is developed on GitHub. 1. Open a terminal to get a command prompt. 2. Consider using a virtual environment manager like conda. Create a new environment by typing the following commands into the command prompt (it might take a few minutes). conda create python = 3 .7 -n wrangler_env conda activate wrangler_env I chose wrangler_env as the name of my environment, but you could choose something else\u2026just remember it so that you can access it later. NOTE in order to get back to \u201cthis\u201d conda environment (i.e. after you close this command prompt), you will need to access it from the command line by using the following command: conda activate wrangler_env 3. Install finicky Requirements Some requirements are best installed using conda rather than \u201cpip\u201d conda config --add channels conda-forge conda install rtree geopandas osmnx 4. \u201cClone\u201d (aka download) network wrangler from Github on to your machine If you have GitHub desktop installed, you can either do this by using the GitHub user interface by clicking on the green button \u201cclone or download\u201d in the main network wrangler repository page . Otherwise, you can use the command prompt to navigate to the directory that you would like to store your network wrangler clone and then using a git command to clone it. cd path to where you want to put wrangler git clone https://github.com/wsp-sag/network_wrangler Expected output: cloning into network_wrangler... remote: Enumerating objects: 53 , done . remote: Counting objects: 100 % ( 53 /53 ) , done . remote: Compressing objects: 100 % ( 34 /34 ) , done . remote: Total 307 ( delta 28 ) , reused 29 ( delta 19 ) , pack-reused 254 Receiving objects: 100 % ( 307 /307 ) , 15 .94 MiB | 10 .49 MiB/s, done .

Navigate your command prompt into the network wrangler folder and then install network wrangler in editable mode. This will take a few minutes because it is also installing all the prerequisites. cd network_wrangler pip install -e . [ tests ] Note: the [tests] flag makes sure to install the testing and development requirements as listed in requirements.tests.txt There will be a lot of messy output, but it should end with something like: Running setup.py develop for network-wrangler Successfully installed Rtree-0.8.3 attrs-19.1.0 cchardet-2.1.4 chardet-3.0.4 click-7.0 click-plugins-1.1.1 cligj-0.5.0 cycler-0.10.0 decorator-4.4.0 descartes-1.1.0 fiona-1.8.6 geojson-2.4.1 geopandas-0.5.1 idna-2.8 isoweek-1.3.3 jsonschema-3.0.2 kiwisolver-1.1.0 matplotlib-3.1.1 munch-2.3.2 network-wrangler networkx-2.3 numpy-1.17.0 osmnx-0.10 pandas-0.25.0 partridge-1.1.0 pyparsing-2.4.2 pyproj-2.2.1 pyrsistent-0.15.4 python-dateutil-2.8.0 pytz-2019.2 pyyaml-5.1.2 requests-2.22.0 shapely-1.6.4.post2 six-1.12.0 urllib3-1.25.3 6. Test the Installation You can test that network wrangler was properly installed by running the tests as follows: pytest Note: if you are not part of the project team and want to contribute code back to the project, please fork before you clone and then add the original repository to your upstream origin list per these directions on github . Using Docker \u00b6 Install Docker Clone git repository (see instructions above) NOTE: this is easiest way right now since repo is private. When it is public we can clone right from github without having to muck around with logins or keys From the cloned repository, open a terminal from the /docker folder and build and run the docker container corresponding to what you want to do by running docker-compose run <container name> <entry point (optional)> --build Command to exit container: exit Containers: - wrangler-jupyter started by running docker-compose run wrangler-jupyter --build is appropriate for running and testing wrangler. - Default action is to start jupyter notebook which can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8888 - Safe: It creates an empty folder to store jupyter notebooks within the container but wont overwrite the source files on your actual machine. - Starting Bash: You can also start the container with a command line using docker-compose run wrangler-jupyter /bin/bash --build . - Doesn\u2019t install development dependencies (although they can be installed from within the container) - wrangler-ci is a small image without extras meant for running tests and deploying to continuous integration server. - default command is to run pytest . - contains development dependencies so that it can run tests and build docs. - wrangler-dev is the most powerful but dangerous container docker-compose run wrangler-dev /bin/bash --build - Warning: It will synchronize code edited from the container to your wrangler clone. This is great for developing within an IDE, but please take this into account. Common Installation Issues \u00b6 Issue: clang: warning: libstdc++ is deprecated; move to libc++ with a minimum deployment target of OS X 10.9 [-Wdeprecated] If you are using MacOS, you might need to update your xcode command line tools and headers Issue: OSError: Could not find libspatialindex_c library file * Try installing rtree on its own from the Anaconda cloud conda install rtree Issue: Shapely, a pre-requisite, doesn\u2019t install propertly because it is missing GEOS module Try installing shapely on its own from the Anaconda cloud conda install shapely Issue: Conda is unable to install a library or to update to a specific library version Try installing libraries from conda-forge conda install -c conda-forge *library* Issue: User does not have permission to install in directories Try running Anaconda Prompt as an administrator.
