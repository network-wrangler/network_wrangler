# Contributing

## Development Workflow

1. Create [an issue](https://github.com/wsp-sag/network_wrangler/issues) for any features/bugs that you are working on.
2. Develop comprehensive tests.
3. Modify code including inline documentation such that it passes *all*  tests (not just your new ones)
4. Lint code to PEP8 using a tool like `black`
5. Fill out information in the [pull request template](https://github.com/wsp-sag/network_wrangler/blob/master/.github/.github/pull_request_template.md)
6. Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch.
7. Core developer will review your pull request and suggest changes.
8. After requested changes are complete, core developer will sign off on pull-request merge.
